Even with a huge workload, Karen always welcomed a stop in for a question or concern, and took the time to ask how things are going in your world. I have also been continually thankful for her depth of knowledge about VDH IT and history of its systems, including decision points along the way that have made things what they are today. That knowledge and dedication to this group and our work is invaluable and will be a considerable gap to fill. \n\nI know we are all going to miss Karen, I certainly will."

Karen was so incredibly helpful and patient, explaining to me the VDH/ADS history, connections, and separations. She has always made me feel welcome popping into her office with a question or two, walking me through finding solutions, and when necessary, piping up to advocate for our requests. I watch in awe at the supportive, encouraging, and respectful relationship that she has with her staff.  Hers will be a hard act to follow, for sure!\n\nI will miss being able to get answers so clearly regarding IT issues.  Whenever there is a question or a discrepancy in the information I've been given, Karen tracks down the correct information and contact person, and then provides follow-up in writing so I always have a reference point. I have loved working with her as she strove to maintain the ADS/VDH connection - the staff from each are working toward the same goal and achievements. While from different Agencies, I feel like she's done an amazing job being inclusive and forward thinking.  Everything is approached with a spirit of cooperation and mutual respect. \n\nI will miss her smile and her laughter - she has an amazing sense of humor that pulled me through frustrations and aggravations and kept me focused on the lighter, more humorous and optimistic side of things.\n\nI could go on singing her praises - suffice it to say I will miss her horribly!"

        "response": "If you met Karen Clark on the street in passing, without knowing who she was, your first impression might be: lifelong athlete. Runs marathons? Maybe she is a river rafting guide, or a Wilderness First Responder? Perhaps she's on the staff of the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS)? Later you might find out that in fact she skis the Biathlon, the Olympic sport that combines cross country skiing with precision rifle target shooting on a timed course. Biathletes train year-round, and Karen always takes a brisk daily walk at lunch. So you wouldn't be surprised to learn that she has done this for decades. But you'd have to guess, because with a smile and a wave, Karen is on the move again.\n\nWhat might surprise you, if you didn't know what Karen does, is that she also led the AHS VDH IT team. There are many individually talented IT people in state government, but the Agile teams at VDH IT gained a unique cohesiveness and esprit de corps under Karen's leadership.  Because Karen is a Coach at heart, we could not be anything else but cohesive and effective in our work. Always focusing on the fundamentals, getting to the heart of any problem, relentless execution wrapped up in a spirit of fun.\n\nLast year, Karen gave the entire VDH IT team gift cards to the Outdoor Gear Exchange-- a wonderful and totally unexpected surprise for me, since I shop a lot at OGE. A $100 gift card buys some serious gear. This was a typical generous team thank you from Karen, but not in the sense of 'Hey, go out for dinner or see a movie'. The message was: 'Go out and challenge yourself instead. The whole you, not just the computer scientist you. Go find a piece of outdoor gear that you would not normally get for yourself.'\n\nSo the gift card bought a set of expeditionary over-mittens, the kind of winter gauntlets bigger than a loaf of bread that come up to your elbow.  The kind that Admiral Peary and Roald Amundsen wore on their way to the North and South Poles. Only theirs were made out of reindeer hide. Mine were Black Diamond Gore-Tex shells with leather palms and Polar fleece lining 'the kind that Peary and Amundsen only WISHED they'd had. They were marvelous and total overkill, but just what I'd wanted for a long time. So I threw them in a day pack for padding heavier items I carry, and then forgot all about them.\n\nAbout a month later I'm on a weekend day hike late in the afternoon and temperature suddenly drops as the wind picks up.  I had on light fleece gloves and a jacket with a zipper that jammed easily.  I have to take off my gloves to work the zipper to get it closed properly. Instead of stuffing the gloves in my pockets, I foolishly dropped them on the snow while I tried to work the zipper. A big gust of wind blew the gloves away and blasted my eyes with ice crystals. Unable to see or find my missing gloves, I've got a real problem now. I've had a cold weather injury before, and unprotected hands quickly lose the ability to do anything. I have to get the coat zipped up, but I have to warm my hands first.  I dump the daypack contents out to find a scarf I can at least wrap my hands in, but no scarf. This is now officially really bad.\n\nInstead I find Karen's gift card over-mittens, that I'd forgotten I'd even brought with me. Instant safety and total comfort. My eyes unstick and my frozen hands warm up so fast I can even take them out of the over-mittens to fix the broken zipper.  A potentially life-threatening situation goes to a 'be smarter next time' lesson in under 30 seconds. You can even laugh at sub-zero windchill that was trying to kill you 5 minutes ago when you now have the equivalent of down sleeping bags on your arms. Preparation saves.\n\nSo Karen thank you so, so much for your years of steady leadership and constant care of all of us at AHS VDH IT. We will miss you greatly, but we will also know that you will provide the same standards and example to your new team at DCF.  Wishing you all the best on your new expedition! ---John Hanning"

I can in no way sum up the past 10+ years of working together in a few simple thoughts, but if I had to it would be 'Thank You'.  \n\nI have learned a tremendous amount in working with you.  You have helped push me in areas I have needed to grow, but also assured me of your support and advocated for me at every opportunity.  You have created a workplace that fosters a culture of creativity, responsibility, ownership, and respect among peers.  You have assembled a team that is not only skilled, but incredibly productive.  Along with this team you have assured that the tools and systems are in place to allow the Department of Health to not just succeed but excel in its mission.  Thank you!\n\nWhen I first came to work for the IT team after several years working for different programs across the Department of Health, I received questions from some of my public health peers, confused as to why I would want to go work for a Division they saw as somewhat distant from the core work of public health.  Those are not the comments I get now.  I credit you as a key part of transforming the culture, relationship, and general understanding of what IT contributes to the Department.  The comments I receive now typically cast IT staff as respected partners, resources and leaders who understand and help programs succeed in their mission.  Thank you!\n\nOne aspect of the way you work that I hold as a model to aspire to is embracing professional growth as a life-long pursuit and part of the job.  On an individual level I am always impressed with your willingness to recognize when your actions or the outcome you achieved did not match your goals and then seek out advice or training.  As a manager I am impressed with the consistency with which you truly believe in your team on many levels. Your strategies of recruiting developers with potential vs. experience and then providing real opportunity for them to grow has welcomed a tremendous amount of talent to our team.  Your strategy of flattening leadership and trusting your senior staff as a team has allowed us to focus on our strengths and built both trust and collaboration.  You are quick to celebrate when a member of your team succeeds in a project, shows a new skill, or takes on new responsibility.  You are willing to give people opportunities to stretch and space to learn.  Our Agile teams could never have succeeded if you had not recognized that they needed space to make mistakes and advocated to assure this was maintained.  The staff of your team feel valued because they are.  Thank you!\n\nI wish you well and look forward to any opportunities to continue to work together in your new role.\n\nThank you,\n\nTim"

In that time we've seen so many changes - commissioners coming and going, changing leadership, and re-structuring of state IT.  We've seen a lot of co-workers come and go too.  Sometimes it's hard to say goodbye, sometimes it's not so hard.  This time it hurts.  \n\nIt hurts on a professional level because you have brought so much to the VDH team.  EVERYONE at VDH (and beyond) knows you are the reason behind our successes.  There is no denying that you have a strong work ethic and you value training and education to keep our skills current.  You have always encouraged us to keep learning and have supported our professional growth, even when it sometimes means losing people to other employers.  A lot of managers would be selfishly unsupportive of their staff moving on, but you are genuinely happy for your staff when they have an opportunity and take it.  As a manager, it is part of your job to invest in your team, but you have taken it further and invested in each one of us as a person.  We are better developers and team members because of you.  I have always appreciated your straight talking, no-nonsense management style.  It's unfortunate and just outright wrong that you are being punished for the very thing that makes you a great manager.  We get the job done because we work hard and make decisions based on what works and what is economically prudent, not because we need to stroke somebody's ego or play power games.\n\nIt hurts on a personal level too.  Not only are you the boss, I think of you as a friend as well.  Your door has always been open and I appreciate you lending an ear when I have had personal challenges where I've needed a little advice or just a sympathetic ear.  It's also nice just to talk about our families, share funny stories, or have those day to day conversations about books we have enjoyed or vacations we have taken.  We have had some fun times too.  I still remember the look on Dan Smith's face when we did the 'I want to be in America' song and dance from West Side Story in front of your office.  He was thinking we were a little crazy, probably everyone else too - it still makes me laugh.  I also remember one day that you called in sick because you flipped your bike at St. Mike's and dislocated your elbow. This is the only day I ever remember you calling in sick in 15 years.  Dan and I drew cartoons of you crashing your bike on the board with your arm jutting out at a weird angle.  Ha ha!  Maybe that wasn't very nice, but I do remember you laughing when you came back the next day. And then there is the story that you told me about Brian and you being on the same plane with David Ortiz and how he and Brian used side by side urinals in the airport. I hope Brian was OK with you telling me about his 'brush with fame' because now it's in writing for all to see!  (ok well maybe just Kyle and you 😉)\n\nIt is very sad and frustrating to see you go, but I hope this is not the end of our relationship.  Please don't break up with me!!! 😉  I would wish you good luck or wish you a successful transition but I already know you will be successful wherever you go or whatever you do.  Please keep in touch and don't forget how much the last 15 years has meant to me, the team, VDH, and Vermont.  You've made a positive impact in public heath and you should be proud of everything you have accomplished.  You did good, girl!\n\nThank you for everything,\n\nSandra"

Throughout her tenure, I've found Karen to be the epitome of an IT professional.  Karen's unwavering, lead-by-example style and consistent track record for 'doing what is right, not what is easy' has enhanced VDH's technical stability tenfold.  Karen's contributions to VDH's technical success are too numerous to list, but without a doubt, each one of them were accomplished by a person whose heart and head were always in the right place."

Karen went the extra mile and reached out to other states on our behalf to inquire about whether or not using their system was a possibility. All the best in your new position, Karen!

This project was a gnarly mess when I started four years ago, but we hunkered down and pushed through it week after week in our SC meeting for 2.5 years and the lab now has a functioning LIMS system. \n\nLooking back on those meetings, I will miss the respectful and thorough manner in which you broke down complex IT concepts and systems for novices like me, arming me with the essential information I need to make informed decisions. I will miss our quick conversations at the end of the day, when you just wanted to check your thinking or ask for some feedback about a challenging situation. These conversations underscored your genuine desire to understand alternate perspectives and check your thinking before moving ahead. It also takes guts and grit to pause and ask: what can I do better? You taught me that this kind of openness and vulnerability is critical to professional growth and I've tried to replicate the practice in my own interactions with colleagues. \n\nYour institutional knowledge, drive and expertise will be greatly missed here at VDH, Karen and if there is anything we can do to pull you back into the VDH fold, I stand at the ready to make it happen. I do hope our paths cross early and often."

She was always responsive, and her knowledge of how things fit together, who to tap for what assistance, and her confidence in finding a way has been invaluable. \n\nAnd, is it Karen who waves the magic wand to cause ADS folks to bring all manner of scrumptious food on various occasions? Also a priceless management trait!\n\nI will sure miss Karen."

Instead she took on all those challenges and tackled them one by one.  She hires excellent people around her, she knows how to delegate, she knows how to say no!  All of those great attributes that made her great as a developer she transformed into the abilities necessary to be just as successful on the management side.  \n\nWhen ever a problem falls into Karens lap I know its in good hands and will be dealt with accordingly.\n\nI will truly missing working with you if we were to ever return to the VDH building-lol\n\nI wish you the best of luck at DCF."

I can honestly and proudly say that you are one of the finest managers I ever worked with in my 22+ year career in IT. I am honored to personally experience and learn from you on how exceptional a manager can be in identifying/promoting talents, providing freehand to the team members to pursue their interests, rewarding performance at every opportunity, getting things done without micromanagement, shielding team from excess work load, being on top of customer needs, separating needs vs wants and above all establishing a work culture that is stress free, friendly, fun-loving and performance driven. It is a testament to your people driven approach that you take all admin work from team's plate and let the team perform the core work that they really enjoy doing. \n\nI also truly admire the transparency and straightforwardness in your thoughts and practices which is rarely demonstrated in management positions. Personally, you always stood by me like a true leader/friend at every step and supported me in various ways, often going out of the way. In 2018, I was at cross roads due to a difficult family situation and in all likelihood I would have quit my job with VDH to pursue other opportunities. Due to your leadership, support and confidence in me, I was able to tide over those tough times and continuing still in my current position at VDH. \n\nI am very thankful for having you as my leader and I sincerely wish to have the opportunity to work with you again in near future. Until our paths meet again, my best wishes to you in the new role. I can't help but feel how lucky DCF IT team is. THANK YOU so much Karen for everything you did to me and to the organization 🙏🙏🙏\n\nBest Regards,\nRahul Beeram"

When I am not sure who to ask, I go to Karen, and while she probably could delegate to someone, she most often responds to me directly and takes the time to explain the cause of the issue. \n\nOne of the things that stands out in my memory is Karen’s patience in working with external vendors.  There have been numerous times over the years when Karen had to work with our EVVE vendor to resolve a problem and it went on for days or even weeks. A recent example is last December when Karen proactively reached out to the EVVE vendor about updating our security certificate more than a month before it was set to expire.  There were multiple emails back and forth over several weeks because the vendor was not able to accept Vermont’s new certificate and they couldn’t figure out the problem.  They kept asking Karen to “try this…” and “do this...” until they finally figured it out right before our current certificate was set to expire.  It took a lot of Karen’s time, but she responded promptly to each of their “asks”.\n\nKaren and I share a passion for physical activity and I will miss our conversations about running and hiking and related injuries and discussions around the latest physical accomplishments by our mutual friend, Stuart. 😊"
